# How to become a Partner

To become a partner with PizzaPlayground you can email: evanrunnercontact@gmail.com
which is my personal email which will be harder to reach or you can go for the
company email: pizzaplaygroundcontact@gmail.com and email about becoming a partner
and link the games you have and we will review it to see if your games suit the
PizzaPlayground platform, if you require a revenue sharing agreement to be signed
then we will take longer reviewing because we need to read everything on the legal
document if everything then works out then your games will be on PizzaPlayground

# Why Open-Source Pizza Playground

PizzaPlayground is open-source so anyone can view the source code not for
malicous purposes but for helpful ones like commiting a bug fix if you are
aware of any bugs or see a better way for code to be and think it would
better suit the platform

# Why Create PizzaPlayground

PizzaPlayground was made after a previous project of mine called PlexyGames
which was not legal and did not follow copyright law and was taken down thats
why PizzaPlayground was created and was created to be a even better and greater
and outdo its origns
